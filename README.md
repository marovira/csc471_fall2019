# CSc 471 Fall 2019

In this site you will find the following class materials (per folder):

* `lectures`: all of the lecture notes. They will usually be published after class.
* `resources`: lists of books, websites, etc. that you may find useful or interesting.

If you have any questions, please email me or come to my office hours. You are **strongly** encouraged to ask any questions you have in person (be it during or after class, in my office hours, or by appointment). Many things can be solved with a 5 minute question over a series of emails.

**IMPORTANT** Assignments will be given and handed in through our *connex* site, not through here.
