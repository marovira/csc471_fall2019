# Memory Management for the GPU

Elements from this lecture were taken from the following talk of CppCon 2017:

* "Design Patterns for Low-Level Real-Time Rendering" by Nicolas Guillemot. You
  can view the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdPeXJ0eiGc). The
  lecture mainly focused on Part 1 of the talk, specifically on memory
  management and command lists.
* The discussion on staging buffers and their use in Vulkan was based on the
  corresponding chapter from the Vulkan Tutorial and can be viewed [here](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Vertex_buffers/Staging_buffer)
