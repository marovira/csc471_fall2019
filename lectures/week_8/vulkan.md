# Vulkan API

This lecture was derived from several sections of the Vulkan tutorial as well as
the Vulkan specification itself. For reference, review the following sections of
the tutorial:

* [Swap chain](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Presentation/Swap_chain)
* [Graphics pipeline basics](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Graphics_pipeline_basics/Introduction)
    * From this section, read the Introduction, Shader modules, and Fixed
      functions.
