# Additional Resources

## C++ Resources

### Books

* **The C++ Programming Language by Bjarne Stroustrup**: this is the official
  documentation of the C++ programming language written by the creator of C++.
  It is long, and very dense, but it does provide a very complete and detail
  explanation of the language, it's features, and why things are the way they
  are.
* **A Tour of C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup**: a condensed version of the previous
  book. It's straight to the point and showcases the major features without
  delving too deep into the language itself.
* **Effective C++ Series by Scott Meyers**: in my opinion, the best reference
  for how to program in C++. Contains 'items' which outline cases, and what to
  do with them. Clear explanations, concise examples, and a light touch make it
  an easy book to read and good as a reference. 
* **Exceptional C++ Series by Herb Sutter**: a series of problems on C++, these
  books force you to really think about the language and can be quite
  challenging at times. They offer very good insight into how C++ works and
  overall makes you a better programmer for it.
* **Modern C++ Design by Andrei Alexandrescu**: very technical book, but it is a
  veritable gold-mine of programming patterns and their solutions. It is aimed
  at advanced programmers, but there's still much to learn from this book (I
  know I have).

### Websites

* [csc116_fall2018](https://github.com/marovira/csc116_fall2018): these are my
  notes and exercises for a C++ course I gave last year. Covers everything from
  the fundamentals to more advanced topics like templates and functional
  programming.
* [cpp.sh](http://cpp.sh/): A free, simple C++ shell. Useful for testing small
   programs. Fully C++14 compatible (though C++17 features won't work).
* [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/): a *complete* specification of the
  language and the standard library. Everything and anything you could ever need
  is here. The specification is technical, but they sometimes provide live
  examples on how to use things. It is updated to the latest standard (C++20)
  and clearly notes what features belong to which standards.

## OpenGL Resources

### Books

* **OpenGL Programming Guide 9th Edition:** The official "Red Book" for OpenGL.
  Contains a full explanation of the *entire* API and it's functions along with
  examples of how to use them.

* **OpenGL 4 Shading Language Cookbook 2nd Edition:** Contains "recipes" for
  several common rendering techniques written with modern OpenGL. Very good for
  quick reference when wanting to get simple stuff done fast.

### Websites

* [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/): a good resource for understanding
  OpenGL. Utilizes a lot of the same libraries that we'll be using in this
  course and is written with modern OpenGL. Overall a good reference for how to
  set things up.

* [Guide-to-Modern-OpenGL-Functions](https://github.com/Fendroidus/Guide-to-Modern-OpenGL-Functions):
  I've found myself using this quite frequently to remind myself of what the
  modern functions from OpenGL are and how to use them. It does assume knowledge
  of OpenGL, but once you understand it, it is a very good quick guide.
